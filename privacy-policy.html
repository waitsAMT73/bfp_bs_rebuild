                <h4 class="fw-bold py-3">Disclosure of Information to Other Health and Social Care Professionals</h4>
                <p>We may need to pass some of this information to other health and social care professionals in order to provide you with the treatment and services you need. Only the relevant part of your record will be released. These other professionals are also legally bound to treat your information with the same duty of care and confidentiality that we do.</p>
                <h4 class="fw-bold py-3">Disclosures Required or Permitted Under Law</h4>
                <p>The law provides that in certain instances personal information (including health information) can be disclosed, for example, in the case of infectious diseases.</p>
                <h4 class="fw-bold py-3">Disclosure of information to Employers, Insurance Companies and Solicitors</h4>
                <p>In general, work related Medical Certificates from your GP will only provide a confirmation that you are unfit for work with an indication of when you will be fit to resume work. Where it is considered necessary to provide additional information we will discuss that with you. However, Department of Social Protection sickness certs for work must include the medical reason you are unfit to work.</p>
                <p>In the case of disclosures to insurance companies or requests made by solicitors for your records we will only release the information with your signed consent.</p>
                <h4 class="fw-bold py-3">Use of Information for Training, Teaching and Quality Assurance</h4>
                <p>It is usual for GPs to discuss patient case histories as part of their continuing medical education or for the purpose of training GPs and/or medical students. In these situations the identity of the patient concerned will not be revealed</p>
                <p>In other situations, however, it may be beneficial for other doctors within the practice to be aware of patients with particular conditions and in such cases this practice would only communicate the information necessary to provide the highest level of care to the patient.</p>
                <p>Our practice is involved in the training of GPs and is attached to a General Practice Training Programme. As part of this programme GP Registrars will work in the practice and may be involved in your care.</p>
                <h4 class="fw-bold py-3">Use of Information for Clinical Audit</h4>
                <p>It is usual for patient information to be used for clinical audit in order to improve services and standards of practice. GPs on the specialist register of the Medical Council are required to perform yearly clinical audits. Information used for such purposes is done in an anonymised or pseudonymised manner with all personal identifying information removed.</p>
                <p>If it were proposed to use your information in a way where it would not be anonymous or the Practice was involved in external research we would discuss this further with you before we proceed and seek your written informed consent. Please remember that the quality of the patient service provided can only be maintained and improved by training, teaching, audit and research.</p>
                <h4 class="fw-bold py-3">Your Right of Access to Your Health Information</h4>
                <p>You have the right of access to all the personal information held about you by this practice. If you wish to see your records, in most cases the quickest way is to discuss this with your doctor who will review the information in the record with you. You can make a formal written access request to the practice and receive a copy of your medical records. These will be provided to you within thirty days, without cost.</p>
                <h4 class="fw-bold py-3">Transferring to Another Practice</h4>
                <p>If you decide at any time and for whatever reason to transfer to another practice we will facilitate that decision by making available to your new doctor a copy of your records on receipt of your signed consent from your new doctor. For medico-legal reasons we will also retain a copy of your records in this practice for an appropriate period of time which may exceed eight years.</p>
                <h4 class="fw-bold py-3">Other Rights</h4>
                <p>You have other rights under data protection regulations in relation to transfer of data to a third country, the right to rectification or erasure, restriction of processing, objection to processing and data portability. Further information on these rights in the context of general practice is described in the Guideline available at <a href="http://www.icgp.ie/data">http://www.icgp.ie/data</a>. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Commissioner.</p>
